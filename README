= remarks to the user =

The main purpose of this plugin is to track the single molecule fluorescence particles. 
But the objects which can be discrimanted by threshold can be detected and tracked (for example, moving cells). 

What can do this plugin?

PTA is a plugin which runs on ImageJ?

    Detecting and Tracking the multiple particles simultaneously.
    The detection method is centroid and 2 dimensional Gaussian distribution fitting by Levenberg-Marquardt method.
    Running on MacOSX (Intel CPU, 64 bit) and Windows (32bit and 64bit).
    ATTENTION!! Now MacOSX version only runs on MacOSX10.7 or higher. I'm sorry for your inconvenience.

How to use this plugin?

    I strongly recommend you to read Manuals.
    This is a brief way to install this plugin.

    1.  Check your platform. For MacOSX10.7 (or higher) and Windows (32bit, 64bit) platforms are available.
    2.	Put jar files in /jar folder (PTA_.jar, jcommon.jar, jfreechart.jar) to your ImageJ/plugins folder
    3.	Put fit2DGauss.dll (for Win) or libfit2DGauss.jnilib (for MacOSX) in lib folder to your ImageJ older (not plugins folder).

Good luck!
